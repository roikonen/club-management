# Club Management App

>  Simple club management app with two functions: add and list clubs. Created for trying out Play + React and for playing around with [Akka Reactive Streams](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.23/stream/index.html).

[Scala Play React Seed](http://bit.ly/2A1AzEq)

## Version Summary

* [Play Framework: 2.7.2](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.7.x/Home)
* [React: 16.8.6](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Create React App: 2.1.8](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

## How to use it?

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/)

### Let's get started,

* Fork or clone this repository.

* Used any of the following [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) commands which will intern trigger frontend associated npm scripts.

```
    sbt clean           # Clean existing build artifacts

    sbt stage           # Build your application from your projectâ€™s source directory

    sbt run             # Run both backend and frontend builds in watch mode

    sbt dist            # Build both backend and frontend sources into a single distribution artifact

    sbt test            # Run both backend and frontend unit tests
```

* This seed is not using [scala play views](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/ScalaTemplates). All the views and frontend associated routes are served via [React](https://reactjs.org/) code base under `ui` directory.

## Database Schema

```
CREATE TABLE CLUB_MEMBERS (
  CLUB VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  MEMBER VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

## HTTP Endpoints

* HTTP GET /api/clubs
  * Get all clubs, returns an array of clubs
* HTTP POST /api/clubs
  * Post a new club
  
### JSON Schema For HTTP Payloads

  "title": "Club schema for HTTP payloads",
  "type": "object",
  "required": [ "name", "members" ],
  "properties": {

  "members": [
    { "name": "Club Member1" },
    { "name": "Club Member2" }

## Akka Reactive Streams

Data processing between application and database is enabled by creating a data management protocol by using stacked custom [BidiFlows](https://doc.akka.io/api/akka/2.5.23/akka/stream/scaladsl/BidiFlow$.html): codec and grouping.

```
